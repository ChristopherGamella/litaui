# Badge Component

The Badge component is a small label used to highlight information or status. It follows the shadcn/ui design system with support for multiple variants and sizes.

## Design

The badge uses semantic tokens for theming, ensuring consistency across light and dark modes. It includes proper focus states and hover effects.

## Props

- `variant`: Controls the visual style ('primary', 'secondary', 'destructive', 'outline')
- `size`: Controls the size ('sm', 'md', 'lg')
