A complete Angular implementation of shadcn/ui - copy, paste, and customize. Built for Angular 20+ with standalone components, signals, and modern development practices.

## What is shadcn/ui for Angular?

This is not a traditional component library. It's a collection of copy-and-paste components that you can use to build your own component library.

Unlike traditional libraries where you install a package and import components, shadcn/ui provides you with the actual component code. This means:

- **Full Control**: You own the code and can modify it to fit your exact needs
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: No dependency on external packages for UI components
- **Complete Customization**: Every aspect can be customized without fighting framework restrictions
- **Modern Angular**: Built with the latest Angular features (signals, standalone components, etc.)

## Why shadcn/ui for Angular?

### ðŸŽ¯ Perfect shadcn/ui Parity
Identical API and behavior to the original React version, ensuring familiar developer experience for teams working across frameworks.

### ðŸš€ Angular Native
Built specifically for Angular with modern features:
- Standalone components
- Angular signals for reactive state management
- TypeScript-first approach
- Angular CDK integration for accessibility

### ðŸ“± Fully Responsive
Mobile-first design with consistent breakpoints across all components.

### â™¿ Accessibility First
